# Person Management Spring Application

## Getting started:
1. Create new MySQL connection with schema
2. Go to src/main/resources/application.properties and update spring.datasource.url to your new schema
3. Add spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password to the same file
4. Run ManagementApplication
5. You can now test endpoints with tools like Postman (localhost:9191/addPerson, localhost:9191/findAll etc)
